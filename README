Train yourself to instantly know the right-of-way rules!

Note: Configured by defaut for European roads (right-hand-drive, right of way for vehicles coming from the right.)

TODO:
- Add yield / priority signs
    - Add priority minimap additional panel
- show feedback on screen
    - user presses correct key (either direction to drive, or "Down" to stop)
        show "Correct!" in green
    - user presses wrong key: show that they did wrong; show the correct key, and why
        (i.e.:
            "You needed to yield to the car from right!",
            "You needed to go {}, but you stopped!",
            "You needed to go {}, but you went {}!
        )

    - user does not press anything within 1 second: timeout
- score:
    - per intersection: 1/reaction time if correct; 0 otherwise
    - per session: mean of all intersections played

- remove car from signal images; stack them over car image instead
- make player car blue
- Automatic moving through intersection
    - Figure out trigonometrics of turning
        - cases: ahead, left, right
